# AngularHydra
Angular Hydra is a transitional framework that provides a migration path from angular 1 to 2. 

It allows someone (you?) to write code in the style of angular 2 that works perfectly in both Angular 1 and 2.

Upon release of angular 2 things will just work by swapping the library and changing 0 lines of code.

Angular Hydra is a back-port library that allows devs to be ahead of the Angular 2 refactoring power curve by providing a framework that supports a SERVICE oriented architecture with Dependency Injection, MVC style views, nested directives, and chainability. Hydra is Angular version agnostic.
